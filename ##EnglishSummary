NeuroCore™ / 04920∩ – Europa Dataset Benchmark
Europa – Adaptive Signature System v4.0
© 2026 Davide Luca Nicoletti | Proprietary License – All Rights Reserved
Europa is a computational framework for analyzing functional regimes in neurophysiological signals (EEG, iEEG, fNIRS, etc.). It provides pipeline-agnostic metrics and automated report generation (PDF/HTML) to support functional state assessment. FS, DV, FR, and MI metrics are currently under development; this repository provides the framework, not finalized results.
The system implements an adaptive engine that generates stable, comparable signatures across datasets. Its ontology defines latent functional regimes (λ(t)), standardized metrics, and adaptive signatures, providing a formal, replicable structure for analysis, comparison, and integration of new datasets.
Repository contents include the v4.0 Europa pipeline, multi-dataset examples, and automatically generated reports, serving as a foundation for future development and scientific validation.
