## Overview

**Europa** is a computational framework within the **NeuroCore™ / 04920∩ architecture**, designed to analyze and quantify functional regimes in neurophysiological signals.

It provides a **pipeline-agnostic computational layer** for multi-dataset integration, adaptive metric aggregation, and reproducible functional state analysis.

Supported modalities include:

* EEG
* iEEG
* fNIRS
* Other physiological time-series systems

---

## Core Capabilities

Europa enables:

* **Multi-dataset loading and processing**
* **Pipeline-agnostic metric computation**
* **Adaptive signature generation using dynamic metric weighting**
* **Latent functional regime tracking via time-dependent state representation λ(t)**
* **Automated report generation (PDF and HTML)**
* **Cross-dataset visualization and comparative analysis**

---

## Adaptive Signature Model

Europa implements an **adaptive signature system** based on the weighted aggregation of universal metrics:

* **FS** — Functional Stability
* **DV** — Dynamic Variability
* **FR** — Functional Resilience
* **MI** — Metric Integration

These metrics are combined to generate a **stable and comparable functional signature** representing latent regime dynamics.

The adaptive engine automatically updates metric weights to improve:

* Stability
* Cross-dataset comparability
* Temporal convergence

---

## Ontological Definition

Europa defines a formal computational structure based on:

* **Latent Functional Regime (λ(t))**
  Time-dependent representation of system state dynamics.

* **Universal Metrics**
  Pipeline-independent quantitative descriptors.

* **Adaptive Signature**
  Weighted aggregation representing functional identity.

* **Dataset and Pipeline Abstraction**
  Standardized interface independent of acquisition or preprocessing methods.

This structure enables reproducibility, formalization, and cross-system comparison.

## Repository Objective

This repository serves to:

* Establish authorship of the NeuroCore™ / 04920∩ architecture
* Provide a reproducible computational framework
* Enable future scientific validation and metric refinement
* Support integration across heterogeneous datasets

## Development Status

**Important Notice**

The FS, DV, FR, and MI metrics are currently under active development and validation.

This repository provides the computational framework and pipeline infrastructure, not finalized physiological or clinical interpretations.

## Name Origin

The framework "Europa" is named after Jupiter’s moon, reflecting its role as an observational computational layer within the NeuroCore™ / 04920∩ architecture.

Developed and validated within the Project Jupyter environment, Europa operates as an adaptive signature system designed to observe, quantify, and characterize latent functional regimes across heterogeneous datasets.

The name reflects its architectural position as a satellite computational layer supporting analysis, reproducibility, and cross-system comparability.
